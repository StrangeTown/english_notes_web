Granny Pig: Hello, my little ones. Would you like to pick some vegetables from the garden for lunch?

Peppa Pig: Yes, please.

Peppa Pig: Grandpa Pig!

George: Papa ‘ig!

Grandpa Pig: Hello, Peppa, George.

Narrator: This is Grandpa Pig’s vegetable garden. He has grown all these vegetables himself.

George: Grr.

Grandpa Pig: What’s this?

George: Dinosaur.

Grandpa Pig: A dinosaur?

Grandpa Pig: Let’s choose some vegetables for lunch.

Grandpa Pig: Peppa, do you like tomatoes?

Peppa Pig: Yes, Grandpa Pig.

Grandpa Pig: George, do you like tomatoes?

George: No.

Peppa Pig: George does not like tomatoes.

Grandpa Pig: Oh, dear.

Grandpa Pig: Do you both like lettuce?

Peppa Pig: Yes, Grandpa Pig.

George: No.

Peppa Pig: George does not like lettuce.

Grandpa Pig: Oh, dear. I must have something that George likes.

Grandpa Pig: Do you like cucumber?

George: Yuck!

Narrator: George does not like cucumbers. And he does not like lettuce. And he does not like tomatoes.

Grandpa Pig: Well, George, what vegetable do you like?

George: Chocolate cake.

Peppa Pig: Silly George. Chocolate cake isn’t a vegetable.

Grandpa Pig: Maybe George will like the vegetables when they’re made into a lovely salad.

Granny Pig: Oh, lovely fresh tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber.

Granny Pig: First, we have to wash them.

Narrator: Peppa and George help Granny Pig wash the vegetables.

Granny Pig: Maybe that’s enough washing.

Narrator: Granny Pig has made the tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber into a salad.

Granny Pig: Grandpa Pig, can you call everyone to lunch?

Grandpa Pig: Lunch!

Narrator: Granny Pig has made pizza for lunch.

Granny Pig: And here’s some salad made with Grandpa’s tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber.

Grandpa Pig: Tuck in, everyone.

Narrator: George has eaten his pizza, but George does not like the tomatoes, or the lettuce, or the cucumber.

Granny Pig: Oh, dear, George. Don’t you like the salad?

George: No.

Mummy Pig: George, just try a little bit of this lovely tomato.

George: Yuck!

Granny Pig: George, this is cucumber. Grandpa Pig grew it in his garden.

Daddy Pig: Try a piece of lettuce, George. It’s yummy.

Grandpa Pig: Oh, now, now, George. Look what I’m doing.

Grandpa Pig: Now it’s a dinosaur.

George: Dinosaur, grr.

Narrator: George loves dinosaurs. George is eating the tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber.

Mummy Pig: Well done, George.

Granny Pig: Would you like some more, George?

George: Full.

Grandpa Pig: George, are you too full to eat any more tomatoes, lettuce or cucumber?

Narrator: George is too full to eat any more.

Mummy Pig: George, are you too full to eat anything more?

Narrator: George is too full to eat anything more.

Granny Pig: Oh, well. Then you won’t want any of this chocolate cake.

George: Chocolate cake!

Grandpa Pig: My word! George seems to have got his appetite back.
